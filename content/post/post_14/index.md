# What is Vencord / Vesktop?

If youâ€™re a `Discord` user looking for better Linux support, enhanced performance, and powerful customization, Vesktopâ€”powered by Vencordâ€”might be the perfect solution. Vesktop is essentially a custom Discord client that behaves like the web version but with native app benefits, extra features, and support for plugins and themes.

## Recommended Plugins

Here are some of the most useful Vesktop plugins to enhance your experience:

* <b>YoutubeAdblock</b>
  * Finally, an adblocker that works inside the Discord app! `This was the main reason I migrated to Vesktop.`

* <b>FixYoutubeEmbeds</b>
  * Bypass Discord's annoying "Watch on YouTube" restrictions and play videos directly inside the app.

* <b>WebKeybinds</b>
  * Adds missing keybinds to the web version of Discord (which Vesktop uses), making navigation smoother.

* <b>ClearURLs</b>
  * Automatically removes tracking parameters from URLs for added privacy.

* <b>CrashHandler</b>
  * Handles crashes gracefully without forcing you to restart the entire app.

* <b>NoDevtoolsWarning</b>
  * Disables the "HOLD UP" warning when opening Developer Tools. It also prevents Discord from hiding your token, helping avoid random logoutsâ€”a must-have for a smoother experience.

* <b>WebScreenShareFixes</b>
  * Removes the 2500kbps bitrate cap on Chromium and Vesktop clients, improving screen-sharing quality.
