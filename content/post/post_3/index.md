Did you know that itâ€™s possible to host a website using GitHub?

https://pages.github.com/

https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site

Do not forget to set your branch as github page in setup > pages > branch

There is one limitation:
GitHub Pages sites are publicly available on the internet, even if the repository for the site is private
