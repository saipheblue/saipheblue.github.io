[{"content":"\nWhat will you need Geiger–Müller kit (for example this one) Raspberry pi - any model is fine but guide is written for raspberry pi 5. For older models you will need to make some adjustments Hardware Connect 5V to any 5V, Ground to any ground and VIN to GPIO4 (pin 7)\nRpi5 GPIO diagram μSv/h Ratio Check the tube that is installed in your kit. In my case, I have J305. We need to calculate μSv/h ratio based on the tube\u0026rsquo;s sensitivity. For J305, almost everyone is using the wrong coefficient/ratio of 0.00812037037037. Here is the formula I used, together with a source elaborating why 0.0081 is wrong: J305 has 25 CPM 1 / (25 * 60 / 8.77)\nSource\nSoftware I am using Raspbian OS.
