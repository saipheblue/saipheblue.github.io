It is part of your Steam library—just download and run it.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve previously used your headset on Windows, you might encounter an issue with Steam Link on Linux. It displays the error:\n'Streaming VR is not available from that computer.'\nDue to this limitation, we need to use alternative software to pair with SteamVR.\nSideQuest SideQuest is a popular platform for sideloading apps, games, and experimental software onto standalone VR headsets. It expands the possibilities of your VR device beyond the default app store.\nVisit the official SideQuest site for a detailed guide on how to connect your headset, enable developer mode, and install all prerequisites.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re having trouble connecting your headset, ensure you have ADB (Android Debug Bridge) installed. To check, run:\n1 adb version If it’s not installed, you can get it with:\n1 sudo pacman -S android-tools ALVR (Air Light VR) ALVR allows wireless PC VR gaming by streaming games from your PC to a standalone headset like the Meta Quest series. It uses low-latency video encoding to provide a seamless experience.\nDownload ALVR from the official ALVR GitHub releases page\nInstall the APK on your headset using SideQuest. Extract the .tar file on your Arch Linux machine and run the executable. Follow the on-screen instructions to set up ALVR. Be sure to mark the headset as \u0026ldquo;trusted.\u0026rdquo;\nOnce done, start SteamVR.\nFrom there, manually start VR games from your PC. While this is a limitation, once the game is running, you can enjoy your session in the VR headset.\nTips \u0026amp; tricks Fix for Black Screen on Headset If your VR game runs on your PC but your headset displays a black screen, try this fix: Add the following command to SteamVR\u0026rsquo;s launch options:\n~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/SteamVR/bin/vrmonitor.sh %command%\n(Note: File paths may vary depending on where you installed SteamVR.)\nFix for Games Not Launching in VR Mode Is the game not launching in VR mode? Go to the game properties, then to Compatibility, and enable Proton. After that, in General settings or during the first game launch, it will ask if you want to play in normal mode or VR mode.\nHappy gaming ! :) ","date":"2024-12-30T00:00:00Z","image":"https://saipheblue.github.io/p/quest-3-on-arch/3_hu130582962988401804.jpg","permalink":"https://saipheblue.github.io/p/quest-3-on-arch/","title":"Quest 3 on Arch"},{"content":"\nWhat will you need Geiger–Müller kit for example this one Raspberry pi - any model is fine but guide is written for raspberry pi 5.
